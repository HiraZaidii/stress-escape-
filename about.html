            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>In 2015 the founder of our Stress Escape clinic designed treatments that would not only recover clients
                from their stressed situation but also contribute to their well-being in a sustainable manner. Our main
                aim is to provide our clients the possibility to improve their lifestyle. Not only do we focus on where
                you stand and how you got there we motivate our clients to improve their vision for the future.</p>
            <p>
                Our team of therapist have a wide range of expertise and specialization. This way we can provide each
                individual case with customized stress release therapy. All of our therapist have done an advance
                Diploma in Healthy Lifestyle and Mental Well-Being. We understand that in a stressful situation, comfort
                is of most importance. Our clinic is located in the center of The Hague and easily accessible by car and
                public transport. We believe that are surroundings and space have a lot of impact on the way we feel.
                Thatâ€™s why, our reception and treatment rooms are professionally designed by Shaz Interiors to provide
                calmness and peace.
