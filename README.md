### User Requrements and Expectations

- A simple and intuitive navigation system

- Links and functions that work as expected
- Good presentation and a visually appealing design regardless of screen size
- An easy way to contact the bussines
- Accessibility

### User Stories
I have divided my user stories into two categories: potential clients and returning clients, with the understanding that the goal of informing clients about what we do and our (starting) treatment packages are less of a priority.

Potential clients (first-time user)
Returning clients (returning-user)


#### First-time User 
1. As a first time user, I want to know where the clinic is located
2. As a first time user, I want to know about the treatments
3. As a first time user, I want to know more about clinic
4. As a first time user, I want to get a feel of what to expect at the clinic

#### Returning User
5. As a returnign user, I want to know the opening times
6. As a returning user, I want to find a phone number to call for information
7. As a returning user, I want to see the treatments
8. As a returning user, I want to leave some comment, suggestion or message to the staff
9. As a returning user, I want to find the clinic on social media


#### Site Owner 
10. As the site owner, I want users to read about what we have to offer
11. As the site owner, I want users to know the different type of treatments
12. As the site owner, I want the users to be able to contact us

## Design

### Design Choices
The webpage was designed to look calm and clear. This gives the (perhaps stressed) user the feeling that everything is well organized. 

### Colour
For the colour sheme warm brown tones were by contracting colors from the images using AdobeColor. Afterwards I used ColorSpace to select a matching pallete. To see what contrast matches best I used Eightshapes.

### Fonts
Hubbali was used for the body and Roboto for headings. Both fonts are considered dyslexia friendly.

### Structure
The page is structured in a well know, recognizable, user friendly, and easy to learn way. Upon arriving to the website the user sees a familiar type of navigation bar with navigation bar on the right side and the logo on the left top.
The website consists of 4 separate pages: 
- A homepage with introduction on what the clinic does
- An about page with information on the clinic
- A page with the treatments 
- A contact page with a contact form, a map and information about the bussines section
