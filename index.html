        <h2> Become the best version of yourself </h2>
        <p>
            Depression? Anxiety? Doubts? We have been there and proudly been through it. Stress is an emotional or
            physical reaction to an event. Our body is designed to experience stress, in both negative and positive
            ways. However, if you experience negative stress for a longer period this can be bad for your health. Stress
            can have a negative impact on your work life and personal relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here at Stress Escape we provide help to overcome your stress. We support you to become the best version of
            yourself. As stress triggers each individual differently, we aim to provide you customize support to get
            (back) to a healthy lifestyle and good mental-wellbeing.
