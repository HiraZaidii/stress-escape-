                Depression? Anxiety? Doubts? We have been there and proudly been through it. Stress is an emotional or
                physical reaction to an event. Our body is designed to experience stress, in both negative and positive
                ways. However, if you experience negative stress for a longer period this can be bad for your health.
                Stress
                can have a negative impact on your work life and personal relationships.
